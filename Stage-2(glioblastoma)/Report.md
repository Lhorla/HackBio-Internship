## Heatmap Generation
Color selection is important for interpreting plots in R because it helps communicate data patterns, trends, and differences clearly and effectively. It also makes it easier to differentiate between categories or data groups, reducing confusion and allowing viewers to grasp key information quickly. In addition, considering that a significant portion of the population experiences colorblindness, using colorblind-friendly palettes ensures that visualizations remain clear and interpretable for everyone.
